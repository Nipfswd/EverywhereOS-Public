Abstract:

    i386 kernel debugger COM port transport.  Implements the full
    16550A UART low-level primitives (CpInitialize, CpSetBaud,
    CpQueryBaud, CpDoesPortExist, CpReadLsr, CpPutByte, CpGetByte)
    and the two public transport entry points that the rest of the
    kernel sees: KdComPortInitialize and KdComPortWriteString.

    All I/O is performed in polling mode.  No interrupts are used.

Author:

    Noah Juopperi <nipfswd@gmail.com>

Environment:

    Kernel-mode only.  Must not call malloc, printf, or any libc
    function.

Routine Description:

    Tests whether a 16550A-compatible UART is present at Address by
    performing a non-destructive internal loopback test.  The modem
    control register is set to loopback mode; a test pattern is written
    to the modem control register and read back from the modem status
    register; the modem control register is then restored.

    On a real 16550A in loopback mode, the lower four MCR output bits
    (DTR, RTS, OUT1, OUT2) are reflected in the upper four MSR bits
    (DSR=DTR, CTS=RTS, RI=OUT1, DCD=OUT2).  We test this reflection.

    Returns non-zero if a port appears to exist.

Arguments:

    Address - I/O base of the candidate UART.

Return Value:

    Non-zero if a 16550A-compatible UART responds, zero otherwise.
